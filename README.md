# Advent of Code 2023 - In C

This is my code for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

I am using it to further advance my knowledge of the C Programming Language. If you happen upon this repository and are knowledgeable in C and want to give me pointers (pun intended?), please feel free!

## Puzzle Location

The code is stored in the `puzzles/` directory and separated by day and part.

## Running the Code

WIP - Currently this has only been set up for an Intel Mac, as that is what is convenient for me. I hope to try to
get it set up on Windows as well, but I chose to use C11 for this, and I'm not sure how MSVC does with that. Future problem :)
